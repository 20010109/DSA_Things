EnqueueSorted
By Simon Gabriel Gementiza

DSA
You are tasked with extending a circular queue implementation to support sorted insertion. Normally, a queue only allows inserting elements at the rear, but in this task, you must implement a function enqueueSorted that ensures the queue remains sorted in ascending order after each insertion.

Note:
- Helper functions are provided
- Do not traverse the queue array
