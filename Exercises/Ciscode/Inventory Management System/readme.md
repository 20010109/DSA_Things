# Inventory Management System

You are an inventory manager in a supermarket. Every end of the month, the company bulk orders goods for restocking in the supermarket.

However, due to some logistic issues on the supplier's end, some of the delivery trucks arrived late. Unfortunately, you already restocked a lot of the first batch of products, and instead of your usual routine of restocking them all at once, you have to do it again!

To restock a product, you utilize the aise_assigment list that your manager gave to you. This will help you determine which aisle the product goes to.

If the product isn't in that aisle, you allocate space for the product at the beginning of the aisle. However, due to the late arrival of some trucks, if ever the product is already in the aisle, you increase the quantity of that product.

Additionally, the manager sometimes discontinues some products due to low sales. Because of this, you have to simply remove the product from the aisles.

Your two tasks are to implement the product restocking and the product discontinuation algorithm. The other necessary functions, such as aisle_assignment, are already provided to you.
