## 🚀 Overview

Hello Team! This repository documents the topics and exercises I have tackled throughout CIS2101 - Data Structures and Algorithms, These topics are mainly handled in the C programming language.

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in C. This repository contains my hands-on exploration of fundamental computer science concepts, with multiple implementations and variations for each data structure. - *GPT made this paragraph but it's true*
