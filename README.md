## 🚀 Overview

This repository documents my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms, featuring practical implementations in C. Each directory contains working code with a focus on understanding the internal mechanics, performance characteristics, and real-world applications of fundamental data structures.

From basic arrays to advanced cursor-based implementations, this collection represents a deep dive into how data structures work under the hood.

## 🏗️ Structures & Implementations

### Core Data Structures

| Structure | Implementation Type | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linked List** | Singly Linked | Basic operations, memory management |
| **Stack** | Array & Linked List | Multiple implementations with different backing stores |
| **Queue** | Array & Linked List | Circular buffer and dynamic node versions |
| **Bit Vector** | Array-based | Space-efficient boolean array implementation |
| **ArrayList** | Dynamic Array | Resizable array with automatic growth |
| **Cursor-Based** | Array Simulation | Linked list behavior using array indices |

### Advanced Topics & Exercises
- **Cascade Exercises**: Progressive implementation challenges
- **LL Variations**: Linked List adaptations for Stacks and Queues
- **Multiple Implementations**: Different approaches to the same problem

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To explore any of the implementations:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate** to the directory of the data structure you're interested in (e.g., `cd Linked-List`).
3.  **Compile** the source files using your preferred C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
    ```bash
    gcc -o program file.c
    ```
4.  **Run** the compiled program to see it in action!
    ```bash
    ./program
    ```
